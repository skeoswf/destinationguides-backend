      "body": "This is one experience you simply can’t miss while you’re here. Wondering how the pigs got to Pig Beach? We don't know for sure. Big Major Cay is uninhabited and the pigs are not native to the island. Some say they were left by a group of sailors, who planned to come back and cook them. Or that the pigs swam over from a shipwreck nearby. Wherever they came from, there are now about 20 pigs and piglets living the easy life, with daily visits from Bahamians and tourists. When you visit, be sure to get a selfie with the #swimmingpigs—they’re even cuter in person!",
